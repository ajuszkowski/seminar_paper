One of the useful applications of mathematical logic theory is Automated theorem proving. This is a set of techniques that allow one to verify mathematical statements mechanically using logical reasoning. Although it can be used to solve engineering problems as well, for instance, to prove security properties for a software system or an algorithm.
% 2. Examples (e.g.) and explanations (i.e.) require commas directly before and after the abbreviations, as well as at the end of the examples or the explanation.

This paper compares two widespread tools for automated theorem proving, Coq~\cite{tool_Coq} and Isabelle~\cite{tool_Isabelle}, with respect to the power of expressiveness and usability. For this reason, it firstly gives a brief introduction to the bases of formal systems and automated deduction theory, its main problems and challenges.

% The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.

% //from wiki:
% More generally, the foundations of mathematics can be described as the study of basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important constructions that form the language of mathematics (formulae, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulae, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. 

Informally, \textit{formal proof} is the sequence of statements, based on finite set of fundamental axioms and satisfying the rules of logical inference. \textit{The axiom} is a statement claimed to be true evidently. \textit{The logical inference} is the transfer from one statement (\textit{premise}) to another (\textit{consequence}), which preserve truth, while the rule of logical inference is a principle that allows one to infer the validity of such transfer. 
In formal logic, inference is based entirely on the structure (i.e., form) of those statements, which allows one to apply basic logical rules to any type of proof and thus construct the formal system.

The main goal of the formal system is to be verifiable, i.e. one could \textit{check} its validity. At present, a lot of tools are being developing to automate the process of such checking to run it on the computer. In particular, the systems \textit{Isabelle/ZF}~\cite{tool_Isabelle}, \textit{Coq}~\cite{tool_Coq}, \textit{PVS}~\cite{tool_Pvs}, \textit{ACL2}~\cite{tool_Acl} work in a form of axiomatic set theory and allow the user to enter theorems and proofs into the computer, which then verifies that the proof is correct (these are also called sometimes 'proof assistants').
Another goal of constructing the formal system is having the computer to automatically \textit{discover} the formal proof, which can rely either on induction, or on meta argument, or on higher-order logic. McCuneâ€™s systems \textit{Otter}~\cite{tool_Otter} and \textit{Prover9}~\cite{tool_Prover9} are commonly recognized as the state-of-the-art tools.

In current paper we consider only the systems, which are built to achieve the first goal, i.e. to verify existing proof, since they can be sufficiently applied in software verification, the research area in which both authors are being involved. Two aforementioned theorem provers Coq and Isabelle are examined for the purpose of revealing expressiveness, computation power and usability. These properties are described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:comparison}. 
In Section~\ref{sec:formal_history}, one can find an overview of the history of logic. Then, Section~\ref{sec:formal_theory} gives thorough definitions, typology and basic properties of formal system and formal proof; issues related to theoretical limitations of formal systems are discussed there as well. General methods for automated reasoning are given in Section~\ref{sec:auto_reasoning}. Possible applications areas for automated theorem provers are enumerated in Section~\ref{sec:applications}. The comparison of selected theorem provers is given in Section~\ref{sec:comparison}.

\section{History of formal approach}
\label{sec:formal_history}

Although in most cases our formal models work efficiently, in previous century mathematics experienced deep fundamental crisis caused by the need for a formal definition of the very basis of mathematics. That time many paradoxes in some mathematics have been discovered, so, in 1920s, the three main confrontation schools appeared:
the \textit{logicism} based on work of Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Alfred Whitehead, which stated that mathematics is an extension of logic and therefore it can be reduced to logic partly or fully;
the \textit{formalism} led by David Hilbert, also called the 'proof theory', which advocated classical mathematics with its axiomatic approach;
and the radical \textit{intuitionism} led by Luitzen Brouwer, which rejected this formalisation as unnecessary and even meaningless, claiming that only the objects, which we know how to construct, may exist.
Although the formalism was the leading school, all these schools have contributed important ideas and techniques to mathematics, philosophy and many other scientific and engineering areas~\cite{Fer08}.

One solution for the foundational crisis was proposed by the school of formalism, it is known as Hilbert's program, and aimed to base all existing theories on finite set of axioms, and prove that these sets are consistent~\cite{Zac06}. Thus Hilbert proposed to reduce the consistency of all mathematics to basic arithmetic. 
Unfortunately, these intentions turned out to be rather unrealisable, when in 1931 Kurt GÃ¶del published his two famous incompleteness theorems, that demonstrated the limitations of any formal axiomatic system containing basic arithmetic~\cite{Raa15}. In particularly, he proved that all consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory are incomplete (such that there will always be statements which cannot be proved or disproved within that formulation), and that such formal system can not prove that itself it is consistent (i.e., it is unable to prove that a statement and its negative are both true).
Notwithstanding the fact that the whole mathematics can not be described in a single axiomatic system, the formal approach allows one to build though restricted, but fine, concise and verifiable theories.

\section{Logical foundations}
\label{sec:formal_theory}

// TODO (Paragraph is still in progress)

% a very little banch of history
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
	\item what the logical system is (formally: set of axioms, inference rules)
	\item (?) a brief history of axiomatic approach (Euclid, Hilbert)
	\item what the truth is: completeness
	\item intro to set theory (for notation) +Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory (ZFC)
	\item intro to formal languages
	\item intro to propositional and 1st ordered logic (introduce notation here. Maybe Higher-Order Logic, Non-classical Logics)
	\item type systems (+dependent type, where type checking although may be undecidable, but it verifies the correctness of ), Nominal vs. structural type system. \textbf{Curryâ€“Howard correspondence} (the direct relationship between computer programs and mathematical proofs)
	\item else?
\end{itemize}

According to Formalists: Independence, Consistency, Completeness, Decidability.

Formalists defined four basic properties which every logical system must have:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em
	\item Independence, which means that there arenâ€™t any superfluous axioms. Thereâ€™s no axiom that can be derived from the other axioms.
	\item Consistency, which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.
	\item Completeness, which means the ability to derive all true formulae from the axioms.
	\item Decidability, the Entscheidungsproblem, which asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement and answers "Yes" or "No" according to whether the statement is universally valid, i.e., valid in every structure satisfying the axioms.
\end{enumerate}

Formula (i.e. statement, program) may be:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
	\item provable (either true or false, according to selected set of axioms)
	\item valid
	\item sound
	\item ...
\end{itemize}

		\item program specification (intuitionistic logic),
		\item Model checking: reduce to a finite state space, and test exhaustively.
		\item hardware verification (higher-order logic), 
		\item logic programming (Horn logic), 
		\item and so on.

\section{Comparison of some theorem provers}
\label{sec:comparison}

//TODO (Paragraph is still in progress) 

(in two words: here we consider Coq and Isabelle, bla-bla)

%MOCK from "Certified Programming with Dependent Types" by Adam Chlipala.
%/* ACL2 is notable in this field for having only a first-order language at its foundation. That is, you cannot work with functions over functions and all those other treats of functional programming. By giving up this facility, ACL2 can make broader assumptions about how well its proof automation will work, but we can generally recover the same advantages in other proof assistants when we happen to be programming in first-order fragments

%Isabelle/HOL and Coq both support coding new proof manipulations in ML in ways that cannot lead to the acceptance of invalid proofs. Additionally, Coq includes a domain-specific language for coding decision procedures in normal Coq source code, with no need to break out into ML.

%A language with dependent types may include references to programs inside of types. For instance, the type of an array might include a program expression giving the size of the array, making it possible to verify absence of out-of-bounds accesses statically. Dependent types can go even further than this, effectively capturing any correctness property in a type. PVSâ€™s dependent types are much more general, but they are squeezed inside the single mechanism of subset types, where a normal type is refined by attaching a predicate over its elements. Each member of the subset type is an element of the base type that satisfies the predicate.

\subsection{The Coq theorem prover}
\label{sec:prover_coq}

// TODO (Paragraph is still in progress)

Coq is a formal proof assistant system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs~\cite{tool_Coq}. Coq uses the Calculus of Construction, a higher-order formalism for constructive proofs in natural deduction style, developed by Thierry Coquand~\cite{Coq86}. 
The Calculus of Construction can be considered as an extension of the Curryâ€“Howard isomorphism. % in a way that the latter associates a term in the simply typed lambda calculus with each natural-deduction proof in intuitionistic propositional logic, when the Calculus of Construction extends this isomorphism to proofs in the full intuitionistic predicate calculus, which includes proofs of quantified statements (which are also called "propositions").

(add some core features of Coq ...)

(Coq has been used to formalize ...)

%------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{The Isabelle theorem prover}
\label{sec:prover_isabelle}

// TODO (Paragraph is still in progress)

The Isabelle is an interactive theorem prover, which relies on higher-order logic. It allows mathematical formulas to be expressed in a formal language and provides tools for proving those formulas in a logical calculus~\cite{tool_Isabelle}. Isabelle's main proof method is a higher-order version of resolution, based on higher-order unification.

(add some core features of Isabelle ...)

(Isabelle has been used to formalize ...)

%MOCK from wiki:
%/* it is based on a small logical core to ease logical correctness. Isabelle is generic: it provides a meta-logic (a weak type theory), which is used to encode object logics like first-order logic (FOL), higher-order logic (HOL) or Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). Isabelle's main proof method is a higher-order version of resolution, based on higher-order unification. Though interactive, Isabelle also features efficient automatic reasoning tools, such as a term rewriting engine and a tableaux prover, as well as various decision procedures. Isabelle has been used to formalize numerous theorems from mathematics and computer science, like GÃ¶del's completeness theorem, GÃ¶del's theorem about the consistency of the axiom of choice, the prime number theorem, correctness of security protocols, and properties of programming language semantics. The Isabelle theorem prover is free software, released under the revised BSD license.
